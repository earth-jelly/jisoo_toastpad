# ToastPad
*"Because I couldn't cad a croissant."*

## Overview
My personal macropad designed for all sound stuff I could think of right now: pause/play, fast forward/backward, next/prev. track, audio info display, and volume control!

So far, I have finished routing the PCB and finished original designs for the silkscreen layer for maximum circus aesthetic. 
Additonal info on silkscreen art: all of the animals and characters listed on the board was favorite animals/characters of different hackclubbers on 11/22-11/23 lock-in calls!

I also have started (and struggled a lot with) the CAD! For right now, my theme probably will be toast/bread + Heidi (bc I absolutely love her <33)

I hope you like it!
