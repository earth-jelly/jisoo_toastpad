### Firmware
Toastpad uses KMK firmware to operate. 
It currently supports media pause & play, fast forward & backward, skip to the next/prev. track, volume control, and display music streaming service inpired icons!

#### Final disclaimer
The Toastpad is as flimsy as a wet toast and operates on hopes and dreams.
Do __*NOT*__:
  - expect it to work on the first try
  - blame me for any malfunctions (because I already warned you)
  - try to eat it

Thank you :>
