My personal macropad designed for all sound stuff I could think of right now: pause/play, fast forward/backward, next/prev. track, audio info display, and volume control! 
It would require 5 keys, 1 encoder, and 1 OLED display.

So far, I have finished routing the PCB and made a couple designs for the silkscreen layer for maximum circus aesthetic. 

I hope you like it!
